My Role As Cybersecurity Support Technician at Log(N) Pacific: Strengthening Security Through Vulnerability Management, Security Operations, and Threat Hunting

Succeeding in cybersecurity requires a combination of technical expertise, adaptability, and a proactive approach to problem-solving. During my internship at LOG(N) Pacific as a Cybersecurity Support Technician, I’ve had the opportunity to work hands-on in Vulnerability Management, Security Operations, and Threat Hunting. From conducting deep-dive vulnerability scans using Tenable to automating PowerShell remediation scripts, I contributed to a 100% reduction in critical vulnerabilities across Windows and Linux environments. By implementing DISA STIG frameworks, I helped streamline compliance audits and strengthen security configurations while improving operational efficiency.

In Security Operations, I took a threat-driven approach by developing custom detection rules in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, automating threat isolation, and refining NSG/firewall rules to eliminate brute force attacks. Leveraging Microsoft Sentinel, I created SIEM dashboards that provided enhanced visibility into logon failures, malicious traffic, and Indicators of Compromise (IoCs). Through KQL queries, I identified anomalies and attack patterns, refining our ability to detect and respond to threats before they escalate. This hands-on experience reinforced my passion for security automation, adversary tracking, and cloud security hardening.

I’m incredibly grateful to Josh Madakor for his guidance and mentorship during this internship. His support has been invaluable in refining my approach to cybersecurity challenges. Moving forward, I’m excited to apply my skills in SIEM engineering, endpoint security, and threat intelligence in a full-time role where I can continue making a measurable impact. If you’re looking for someone with a strong analytical mindset, experience in enterprise security tools, and a passion for proactive threat detection, let’s connect!
